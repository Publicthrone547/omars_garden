# Portfolio Website

**Omar’s Garden** is an experimental front-end project focused on building a smooth, scroll-driven horizontal experience.  
The project explores how horizontal scrolling can create a more engaging and immersive way of navigating web content.

By translating vertical scroll input into horizontal motion, the website turns scrolling into a guided visual journey rather than a traditional page flow.

## Features

- Smooth, scroll-driven horizontal layout  
- Vertical scroll input mapped to horizontal movement  
- Pinned sections with timeline-based animations  
- Motion-first navigation approach  
- Experimental layout composition  

## Technologies

The project is built using modern motion and animation tools.

- **Locomotive Scroll** — smooth scrolling and scroll input handling  
- **GSAP (GreenSock)** — animation engine and timeline control  

## Languages
Currently available in English and Russian.
